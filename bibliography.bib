abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data technologies have emerged as a critical data analytics tool to bring the knowledge within IoT infrastructures to better meet the purpose of the IoT systems and support critical decision making. Although the topic of Big Data analytics itself is extensively researched, the disparity between IoT domains (such as healthcare, energy, transportation and others) has isolated the evolution of Big Data approaches in each IoT domain. Thus, the mutual understanding across IoT domains can possibly advance the evolution of Big Data research in IoT. In this work, we therefore conduct a survey on Big Data technologies in different IoT domains to facilitate and stimulate knowledge sharing across the IoT domains. Based on our review, this paper discusses the similarities and differences among Big Data technologies used in different IoT domains, suggests how certain Big Data technology used in one IoT domain can be re-used in another IoT domain, and develops a conceptual framework to outline the critical Big Data technologies across all the reviewed IoT domains.}

abstract = {Supported by current socio-scientific trends, programming the global behaviour of whole computational collectives makes for great opportunities, but also significant challenges. Recently, aggregate computing has emerged as a prominent paradigm for so-called collective adaptive systems programming. To shorten the gap between such research endeavours and mainstream software development and engineering, we present ScaFi, a Scala toolkit providing an internal domain-specific language, libraries, a simulation environment, and runtime support for practical aggregate computing systems development.}

abstract = {The notion of a computational field has been proposed as a unifying abstraction for developing distributed systems, focusing on the computations and coordination of aggregates of devices instead of individual behavior. Prior field-based languages, however, have suffered from a number of practical limitations that have posed barriers to adoption and use. We address these limitations by introduction of Protelis, a functional language based on computational fields and embedded in Java, thereby enabling the construction of widely reusable components of aggregate systems. We demonstrate the simplicity of Protelis integration and programming through two examples: simulation of a pervasive computing scenario in the Alchemist simulator [24], and coordinated management of a network of services.},

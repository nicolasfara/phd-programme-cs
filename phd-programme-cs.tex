\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\section{State of the Art}\label{sec:state-of-the-art}

\section{Project description}\label{sec:project-description}

This project aims to figure out a practical and effective methodology to tackle the complexity
collective adaptive applications face when deployed on heterogeneous infrastructures,
and adaptation is a must-have requirement.
%
In particular, the project will focus on finding methods and tools to support the
engineering of complex adaptive systems mainly focused on the \ac{iot} domain
where the \ac{ac} paradigm emerges as a prominent solution.

Several challenges arise when designing
and deploying collective adaptive applications on heterogeneous infrastructures;
for this reason, most of the research efforts leverage the simulation
as a powerful tool to test and validate the proposed solutions.
%
With this project, we aim to ``bridge the gap'' between the simulation and the real world,
providing, as stated above, a set of \emph{methodology}, \emph{tools}, and \emph{techniques}
that can be seamlessly exploited to effectively tackle the system's complexity.

To achieve this goal, the starting point is the \emph{pulverisation} approach
which born in the \ac{ac} framework and represents a powerful and effective 
methodology to describe such systems via a compositional approach.
%
Extension to this approach will be investigated to support dynamic reconfiguration
of the system, allowing it to adapt to the changes in the infrastructure and external conditions
via, for example, machine learning techniques.
%
\emph{Variety} and \emph{volume} characterize the modern \ac{iot} systems,
and the management of such data is a complex and delicate task,
due to security implications and privacy concerns.
%
For this reason, the project will try to address these issues with
a new concept of ``Big-data for Aggregate Computing'' by leveraging
state-of-the-art big-data techniques.

As follows, is provided a brief overview of the main activities that will be carried out.

\subsection{Activities}\label{subsec:activities}

\meta{
\paragraph{Deployment via pulverisation}
The first fundamental step of this project is to provide an implementation for
the pulverisation approach via a dedicated framework.
%
The framework will be designed to be modular and extensible to allow the integration
of different technologies and give the possibility to be used in conjunction with
\ac{ac} frameworks.

\paragraph{Dynamic reconfiguration and relocation}
Another key contribution of this project is to support dynamic reconfiguration of the system,
allowing it to adapt to the changes in the infrastructure and external conditions.
%
In the original model of the pulverisation approach,
there is no support for dynamic reconfiguration of the system.
%
For this reason,
the project will investigate the extension of the pulverisation approach
to support dynamic reconfiguration and relocation of the system inside the framework stack.
%
To do so,
the project will leverage machine learning techniques to manage the complex task of reconfiguration
to opportunistically balance the performance and energy consumption or any other system-specific \ac{qos}.

\paragraph{Bind pulverisation to AC frameworks}
The need to integrate \ac{ac} framework into the pulverisation one is
a fundamental step to provide a complete solution for the design and deployment of
collective adaptive applications on heterogeneous infrastructures.
%
Indeed, combining the pulverisation approach with \ac{ac} frameworks
allows to describe the system's behavior at a macro-level
but at the same time exploiting the pulverisation to
effectively deploy the system on the available infrastructure,
managing also the dynamic reconfiguration of the system transparently and seamlessly.

\subsection{Scope}\label{subsec:scope}

\subsection{Technology}\label{subsec:technology}

\meta{
\paragraph{Cloud computing}
One of the main objectives of the pulverisation approach is to simplify the development
and the deployment of complex systems on heterogeneous infrastructures.
%
The edge-cloud continuum is a new emerging paradigm that allows exploiting the
advantages of both the cloud and the edge computing (and its continuum).
%
For this reason, it is fundamental to have a deep understanding of the cloud computing
paradigm and its technologies to provide a complete solution for the design and deployment
of this kind of system.
%
In recent years, several cloud providers have emerged, and each of them provides
a set of services and technologies to support the development of cloud-based applications.
%
\emph{Google Cloud Platform}, \emph{Amazon Web Services}, and \emph{Microsoft Azure}
are the most popular cloud providers, and they will be the main focus of this project.
%
Could be strategic to enable the framework to be used with different cloud providers
to allow the user to choose the one that best suits his needs.

\todo{IaaS tools and orchestration tools}


\paragraph{Big-data}
The \ac{iot} systems consist of a large number of devices that produce a large amount of data
from extremely scattered data sources.
%
The handling of such data requires an adequate infrastructure and tools to manage them.
%
For this reason, the project will investigate the use of big-data technologies
such as \emph{Apache Spark}, \emph{Apache Flink} and their integration with the pulverisation approach and the \ac{ac} frameworks.
%
The union of big-data technologies and the pulverisation approach can open new opportunities for \ac{cas}.

\paragraph{Distributed technology}
The resilience of the system is a fundamental aspect to consider when designing
and deploying a collective adaptive application.
%
Due to the highly distributed nature of the \ac{iot} and \ac{ac} systems,
the failure of a node is the norm rather than the exception.
%
For this reason, will be investigated the use of distributed technologies
like \emph{MOM}, microservices patterns and approaches,
and tools like \emph{Apche Zookeeper} to provide a resilient system.

\section{Expected results}\label{sec:expected-results}

\subsection{One year goal}

\paragraph{Pulverization framework}
Realize an effective framework to support the development of complex systems
via the pulverisation approach.
%
We will try to provide a modular and extensible framework to allow the integration
of different technologies and give the possibility to be used in conjunction with
\ac{ac} frameworks.

\paragraph{Dynamic reconfiguration and adaptations}
Extend the pulverisation approach to support dynamic reconfiguration and relocation
of the system inside the framework stack.
%
To do so,
we will investigate the use of state-of-the-art distributed technologies
improving the resilience of the system opportunistically exploiting
the underlying infrastructure.
%
Firstly we will focus on rule-based reconfiguration,
in particular device-based rules, and then we will investigate
global rules to manage the system's behavior at a macro level.

\subsection{Long term contributions}
With the proposed project, we aim to close the gap between the simulation of \ac{cas} and the real world.
%
Moreover, we aim to provide an effective ecosystem -- composed of methodologies, tools, and techniques --
to support the design and deployment of \ac{cas} and \ac{iot} systems on the edge-cloud continuum.

With this project,
we expect to provide one of the first concrete solutions for the engineering of the above-mentioned systems,
and we expect to greater understand the challenges and opportunities of this new approach,
but also the role it can play in modern scenarios like smart cities, smart factories, large-scale \ac{iot} systems, and so on.

In conclusion,
this project can be intended as a first step toward the creation of solid support
for the engineering of resource-efficient, resilient, and adaptive systems
which can exploit the resources also in a sustainable way.
